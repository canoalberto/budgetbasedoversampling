# An active learning budget-based oversampling approach for partially labeled multi-class imbalanced data streams

Learning classification models from multi-class imbalanced data streams is a challenging task in machine learning. 
Moreover, there is a common assumption that all instances are labeled and available for the training phase. However, this is not realistic in real-world
scenarios when learning from partially labeled data. In this work, we
propose an active learning method based on labeling budget that can
tackle multi-class imbalance data, concept drift, and limited access
to labels. The proposed method combines information from budget
constraints and dynamic class ratios to generate new relevant
instances. We performed experiments on 18 real-world data streams
and 11 semi-synthetic data streams, under different labeling budgets,
in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method under
a varied set of scenarios. The experimental study showed that our
oversampling method was able to improve the performance of stateof-the-art classifiers for multi-class imbalanced data streams under
strict budgets and outperforms previously proposed oversampling
methods in the domain.
